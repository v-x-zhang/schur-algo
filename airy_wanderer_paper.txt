The Airy wanderer line ensembles.
The goal of this section is to give a formal de˝nition
of the Airy wanderer line ensembles constructed in [4, 5]. Our exp osition here closely follows that
of [5, Section 1.2]. We b egin by ˝xing the parameters of the mo del and some notation.
De˝nition 1.1.

the set of parameters satisfying the ab ove conditions by

The following prop osition summarizes some basic prop erties of the kernel
K
a;b;c
in De˝nition 1.3.
It was proved as [5, Lemma 1.4] under the assumption that
c

; however, the pro of remains
unchanged for all
c
+

, which is how we state the result b elow.
Prop osition 1 .4.
Assume the same notation as in De˝nition 1.1. For each
t
1
; t
2
; x
1
; x
2
2
R
we have that the double integral in the de˝nition of
K

a;b;c
in (1.3) is convergent. The value of
K
a;b;c
(
t
1
; x
1
;
t
2
; x
2
)
does not depend on the choice of

and

as long as

+
t
1
< a
and

+
t
2
> b
.
Moreover, for each ˝xed
t
1
; t
2
2
R
we have that
K
a;b;c
(

is continuous in

Schur dy nam ics.
In this section we describ e a sampling algorithm for the Schur pro cesses in
De˝nition 3.1. This algorithm was intro duced in [1], and it is based on certain Markov dynamics on
the Schur pro cesses that are based on sequential up date. At a high level, the sampling algorithm al-
lows us to sequentially build
(

(

, distributed according to
P

for

,
where
Y
n
= (
y

; : : : ; y

)
, by evolving the parts of

(
n; j
)
. This evolution of the parts is based on
certain truncated geometric random variables, which we intro duce next.

In words, the distribution

in De˝nition 3.3 is just a geometric distribution
with parameter

, and translated by

We next intro duce the the sampling algorithm.
Sampling algorithm.
Assume
M ; N ; X ; Y
are as in De˝nition 3.1. We pro ceed to sample
f

(
n; m
) :
m
= 0
; : : : ; M ; n
= 0
; : : : ; N
g
as follows.
1.
 Initialization. We set

(0
; m
) =
;
=

(
n;
0)
for
m
= 0
; : : : ; M
and
n
= 0
; : : : ; N
.
2.
 Up date
n
!
n
+ 1
. Assume that
(

(
n;
1)
; : : : ; 
(
n; M
))
have already b een sampled. We
pro ceed to sequentially sample

(
n
+ 1
; m
)
for
m
= 1
; : : : ; M
as follows.
3.
 Sampling

(
n
+ 1
; m
)
. For
i
2
N
, we de˝ne
a
i
= max(

i
(
n
+ 1
; m

1)
; 
i
(
n; m
))
and
b
i
= min(

i

1
(
n
+ 1
; m

1)
; 
i

1
(
n; m
))
, with the convention
b
1
=
1
. Let
X
i
(
n
+ 1
; m
)
b e
indep endent random variables with distributions
p
(
j
a
i
; b
i
; x

y
n

)
as in De˝nition 3.3, and
set

i
(
n
+ 1
; m
) =
X
i
(
n
+ 1
; m
)
.
Remark
3.5
.
By induction on
m
+
n
, one directly shows that

i
(
n; m
) = 0
for all
i >
min(
m; n
)
.
In particular, in the third step of the sampling algorithm we only need to generate ˝nitely many
variables
X
i
(
n
+ 1
; m
)
for
i
= 1
; : : : ;
min(
m; n
)
, making the algorithm implementable on a computer.
Remark
3.6
.
One directly observes from the ab ove algorithm that if
0

m
1

m
2

M
, and
0

n
1

n


N
, then

(
n

)


(
n

)
in the sense that

i

)


i
(
m
2
; n

)
for
i


.
The key result we require ab out the ab ove sampling algorithm is contained in the following
prop osition, which is a sp ecial case of [1, Theorem 10 and Remark 12] (applied to the sp ecializations
in [1, Example 9]).
Prop osition 3.7.
Assume the same notation as in De˝nition 3.1. Suppose that
f

(
n; m
) :
m
=
0
; : : : ; M ; n

; : : : ; N
g
are as in the above sampling algorithm. Then,
(

(
N ;
1)
; : : : ; 
(
N ; M
))
is
distributed according to
P
X ;Y
.
3.3.
Quantile functio ns.
Supp ose that
F
is a cdf on
R
. We de˝ ne the quantile function
Q
asso ciated with
F
via

The following prop osition summarizes the prop erties we require ab out

either proved in [8, Sections 11.4, 11a] or follows immediately from statements there.
Prop osition 3.8.
Suppose that
F

is as in (3.6). Then, the fol lowing al l hold.

 The function

MONOTONICITY AND ASYMPTOTIC SLOPES FOR AIRY WANDERER LINE ENSEMBLES 5
The key result we show in this section is that for certain choices of parameters, we can monoton-
ically couple two distributions as in De˝nition 3.3.
Lemma 3.9 .
Suppose that
q
1
; q
2
2
[0
;
1)
,
a
1
; a
2
2
Z
,
b

; b

Z
[ f1g
satisfy
a
1

b
1
,
a
2

b
2
,
q
1

q
2
,
a
1

a
2
, and
b
1

b
2
. For
i
= 1
;
2
we let
F
i
(
x
) =
F
(
x
j
a
i
; b
i
; q
i
)
be the cdfs from (3.5), and
let
Q
i
denote the corresponding quantile functions. Let
U
be a uniform
(0
;
1)
random variable and
set
X
i
=
Q
i
(
U
)
. Then,
X
i
has distribution
F
i
for
i
= 1
;
2
and
X
1

X
2
.
Proof.
The fact that
X
i
has distribution
F
i
for
i
= 1
;
2
follows from prop erty P3 in Prop osition 3.8.
From prop erty P4 in Prop osition 3.8 and the fact that
F
i
are constant on each interval
(
a; a
+ 1)
for
a
2
Z
, we see that to show that
X
1

X
2
, it su˚ces to prove that for each
x
2
Z
(3.7)
F
2
(
x
)

F
1
(
x
)
:
If
x < a
2
, we see that (3.7) trivially holds as the left side is
0
, and if
x

b
1
, then it trivially holds
as the right side is
1
. We may thus assume that
a
2

x

b
1
, in which case from (3.5) we see that
(3.7) is equivalent to
1

q

q

:
The latter is clear if
q
1
= 0
(as then the right side is equal to
1
), and so we may assume
q
1
>
0
.
Clearing denominators and multiplying b oth sides by
q
a
1

q
a

, the ab ove b ecomes equivalent to
(3.8)
0

By a direct computation we have

where in the last inequality we used that

,
a


a





. In particular, we
conclude that to show (3.8), it su˚ces to prove that for
a

x

b
and
0
< q


q

, we have
(3.9)


G
(

:
If
b

;
which clearly implies (3.9), as
q


q

, and so we may assume that
b <

We ˝nally observe that
(

G

G

The latter shows that

As

we conclude (3.9) and hence the lemma.

6 MONOTONICITY AND ASY MPTOTIC SLOPES FOR AIRY WANDERER LINE EN SEMBLES
3.4.
Monotone couplings of Schur pro cesses.
In this section we establish two typ es of mono-
tone couplings for the Schur pro cesses in De˝nition 3.1. They are b oth established by appropriately
coupling the Schur dynamics in Section 3.2 using Lemma 3.9. Our ˝rst result is as follows.
Prop osition 3.10.

[

; : : : ; 

[

is
P

as in De˝ nition 3.1. In addition, we have for each

Remark

Observe that from (3.11), we have in particular

In [5, Prop osition 3.7] we established a monotone coupling of Schur pro cesses, which ensures (3.12),
and is based on the
Robinson-Schensted-Knuth (RSK)
corresp ondence and
Greene's theorem
. It is
worth p ointing out that the coupling in Prop osition 3.10 is di˙erent from the one in [5, Prop osition
3.7], for which (3.11) may fail for general
k
, see [5, Remark 3.9].
Proof.
Let
(

F
;
P
)
b e any probability space that supp orts
f
U
(
n; m; k
) :
m; n; k

N

, where the
latter are i.i.d. uniform
(0

random variables. We pro ceed to de˝ne

](
n; m
) :
m
=
0
; : : : ; M ; n

; : : : ; N
g
using the sampling algorithm from Section 3.2. We start by setting

[
X ; Y
](0
; m
) =

=

[
X ; Y
](
n;
0)
for
m
= 0
; : : : ; M
and
n
= 0
; : : : ; N
. If

[
X ; Y
](
n

1

)
and

[
X ; Y
](
n; m

have b een constructed, we set for
k

1
(3.13)

k
[
X ; Y
](
n; m
) =
Q
n;m
k
[
X ; Y
](
U
(
n; m; k
))
;
where
Q
n;m
k
[
X ; Y

is the quantile function of the distribution
F
(
j

)
from (3.5) with
a

where as b efore


i
[

] =

[
X ; Y
](
N ; i
)
for
i
= 1
; : : : ; M
. From Lemma
3.9, we know that

k
[
X ; Y
](
n; m
)
has distribution
F
(
j
a
k
; b
k
; q
)
, and so from Prop osition 3.7, we
conclude that under
P
the distribution of the sequence
(

1
[
X ; Y
]
; : : : ; 
M
[
X ; Y
])
is
P
X ;Y
.
What remains is to verify (3.11), for which it su˚ces to show that if

:
Note that (3.15) holds trivially when
m
= 0
or
n
= 0
, as b oth sides are equal to zero. Assuming
that (3.15) holds when
(
n; m
)
is replaced by
(
n

)
or
(
n; m

, we see that

~
a
k
;
~
b
k
are as in (3.14) with
X ; Y
replaced with
~
X ;
~
Y
. From Lemma
3.9 we conclude that for

Q


Q
n;m
k
[

](
U
(

;
which together with (3.13) shows that (3.15) holds for
(
n; m
)
. The fact that (3.15) holds for all
0

m

M ;
0

n

N
now follows by induction on
m

n
.
